      <h2>What is "Famazing?"</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Famazing</em> stands for Family Amazing; a term coined by Brooke Haddad herself, It is used to categorize the crazy family documented below. Famazing can be considered an ideal that is longed for by many, but achieved by few.
It is personified as a blend of love, care, and deep desire for one anothers happiness and success; a beautifully unique concept that grows stronger every family gathering.

         <h2>The Famazing Race</h2>
           <p><em>The Famazing Race</em> is considered by many members of the family to be the epitome of family-awesomeness. This 20 year long tradition consists of family, near and far, garthering at the magical Fort Wilderness campground in Central Florida. While attendance is not mandatory, it may as well be; the missing of such an event is not taken lightly. The functionality of the 30+ person crazy train that is this family does not roll as smoothly without all of its working components. Having missed a few years myself due to lack of appreciation for this train, I can vouch that I will do my best to be there every december.<br /><br /> There is much fun to be had at this festive gathering, such as the midnight bikeride, roasting mallows with chip and dale, and oodles of tapletop games. While fun, these pale in comparison to the pure magnitude that is the <em>Famazing Race</em>. As is hinted with the name, this is an adaptation of the Amazing Race concept: a scavenger hunt with bikes being the primary mode of transportation. The race is executed by the <em>Famazing Ambassador's</em> Grammy and Richard, usually with a few helpers dotted around the campground. The actual conent of the race is created by a rotating member of the Family, creating a uniquely creative experience that changes drastically from year to year. The clues include things such as family history anagrams, <em>Wheres Waldo?</em> hunts, <em>Hidden Mickey</em> challanges, and many more. The progression of creativity over the years is truly impressive and makes each year equally exciting.</p><br /><br />
