      <h2>Media Upload</h2>
        <p>
        We will use this to upload pictures to store in a particular location. The temporary plan is to host on a google drive and put on a hard drive on my end. This way we will not hit the cloud host limit and we can have all filed in one location. Once I get more access to cloud storage these can all be hosted on the cloud if everyone is comfortable with that.
